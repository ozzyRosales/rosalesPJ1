                    <p class="like-p"> My cinematic tastes predominantly gravitate towards the golden era of the early 90s to the early 2000s, where some of my all-time favorite movies originate. Among them, 'Back to the Future' holds a special place in my heart, as its exploration of the complexities of time never fails to captivate my attention. However, it's not just the sci-fi allure that draws me in; movies like 'Boys in the Hood,' 'Blood In, Blood Out,' and 'Fight Club' have left an indelible mark on my creative psyche. The gritty yet poignant storytelling and cinematic craftsmanship of these films have influenced my perspective and creative approach profoundly. They've shaped the way I observe the world, whether it's considering the framing of a shot or pondering the narrative impact of different film effects.</p>

                 <p class="like-p"> I have a diverse appreciation for music, ranging from the electronic beats of Daft Punk, the timeless classics of Michael Jackson, and the energetic sounds of Skrillex to the unique styles of Peso Pluna, Grimes, Coldplay, and MF DOOM. Constantly seeking new sounds and artists that evoke positive emotions is a passion of mine. Growing up, I was immersed in rap and Latin music, which later led me to explore more intricate lyricism and unconventional rhythms. My musical palate is defined by a fusion of rhythm and wordplay. I gravitate towards experimental elements in music, reveling in the pushing of boundaries and the exploration of new avenues of musical expression. </p>

                 <p class="like-p"> Video games have been an integral part of my life for as long as I can remember. From the early days of playing flash games to assembling my own gaming PC a few years back, I've always been captivated by the storytelling and immersive experiences that video games offer. Among my cherished favorites are the God of War franchise, which I aspire to revisit in chronological order someday, along with classics like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and The Simpsons: Hit and Run. These titles hold a special place in my heart, evoking fond memories of my childhood. </p>
