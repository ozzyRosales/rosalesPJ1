                    <p class="like-p">My journey through the vast expanse of the internet began in 2006, a milestone marked by the gift of my first computer, a Dell Dimension e510, from my parents on my birthday. Those early days were filled with endless hours immersed in the world of Nickelodeon and Disney Channel flash games, losing myself in digital adventures until the early hours of the morning. Since then, my online presence has evolved alongside me, becoming an integral part of my life.

           <h4 class="section-title">inspiration</h4>
                 <p class="like-p"> Over the years, my internet explorations have expanded to encompass a wide array of interests, with a particular focus on design inspiration and technology. I find immense joy in the intersection of these two realms, marveling at the innovative ideas and projects that emerge from their fusion. Instagram has become my primary source of inspiration, its algorithm finely tuned to deliver content tailored to my preferences. Yet, when the urge to explore new perspectives strikes, I turn to Twitter, deliberately seeking out diverse voices and viewpoints to broaden my horizons.</p>

                      <p class="like-p"> In recent years, my online presence has undergone a significant transformation. Recognizing the toll personal social media accounts were taking on my time and mental well-being, I made the conscious decision to deactivate and delete them. Instead, I've chosen to utilize social media solely as a platform to explore and exhibit my creative endeavors.

                        My primary outlet for showcasing my work is my Behance page, where I diligently update my portfolio with past projects and new creations. Additionally, I actively participate in communities such as Reddit, sharing my artwork and engaging with fellow creators. Recently, I've discovered a sense of fulfillment in supporting various projects, whether through purchasing prints or simply amplifying the voices of creators by retweeting their works in progress. It's become a gratifying experience to share with others the projects and ideas that resonate with me.</p>
